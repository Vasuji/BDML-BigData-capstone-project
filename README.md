# BDML-BigData-capstone-project

This reposetory includes splunk,knime,Neo4j documents and report from Big Data Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project for Big Data specialization. In this culminating project, I build a big data ecosystem using tools and methods learned during the courses in this specialization. I analyze a dataset simulating big data generated from a large number of users who were playing our imaginary game "Catch the Pink Flamingo". During the five-week Capstone Project, I walked through the typical big data science steps for acquiring, exploring, preparing, analyzing, and reporting. In the first two weeks, I got introduced to the data set and did some exploratory analysis using tools such as Splunk and Open Office. Then I moved into more challenging big data problems requiring the more advanced tools including KNIME, Spark's MLLib and Gephi. Finally, during the fifth and final week, I brought it all together to create engaging and compelling reports and slide presentations.
